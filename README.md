# Flower-Recognition-CNN-using-Keras
"Flower Recognition CNN" is a project implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras for recognizing flower species from images. The model is trained on a dataset of flower images and achieves high accuracy in classification. This project serves as a demonstration of deep learning techniques for image recognition tasks.
